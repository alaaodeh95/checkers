## Checkers using Alpha beta
This Checkers game is designed to adhere to the official tournament rules as outlined at [startcheckers.com](https://startcheckers.com/the-rules-of-checkers/). Players can choose between two modes: a two-player mode for playing against another human, and a one-player mode for playing against a computer-controlled bot. The game offers three levels of difficulty, allowing players to adjust the challenge according to their skills. 

Flexibility is a key feature, as players have the option to reset the game or switch modes and difficulty levels at any stage. Additionally, the game interface is designed to be user-friendly, highlighting movable pieces and indicating allowed moving positions. It also keeps players informed by displaying the count of available pieces for both players, ensuring a smooth and engaging gaming experience.

### AI Strategy and Evaluation Function

In our Checkers game, we've implemented an AI strategy supported by a thoughtfully developed [evaluation function](./src/AI/evaluate.ts). This function dynamically scores game positions to guide the AI's decisions, considering both current and potential future states of the board. The evaluation is based on several factors:

1. **Basic Scoring**: Evaluates based on the number and type of pieces for each player.
2. **Board Control**: Extra points for controlling the center of the board.
3. **Advancement Scoring**: Scores normal pieces that are close to becoming kings (reaching the last row).
4. **Mobility**: Assesses the game based on the mobility of the pieces.
5. **Jump Potential**: Rewards positions that have potential jumps.
6. **Positional Play**: Penalizes pieces that stay too long in their initial positions, encouraging movement.
7. **Endgame Kings**: In the endgame (when 12 or fewer pieces remain), kings receive additional points.

The AI's decision-making is  tuned using the following configuration weights:

```javascript
export const evaluationConfig = {
    centerRows: [3, 4],
    centerWeight: 0.3,
    nearingKingingWeight: 0.5,
    pieceValue: {
        player1: -1, // Opponnet 
        player1King: -3, // Opponnet 
        player2: 1, // Bot 
        player2King: 3, // Bot
    },
    botInitialRow: 7,
    mobilityWeight: 0.2,
    jumpWeight: 0.8,
    endgameThreshold: 12, // Number of total pieces below which the game is considered to be in endgame
    endgameKingWeight: 0.7, // Additional weight for kings in endgame
    minMovesBeforePenaltyOnInitial: 15, // Number of moves before penalties on initial position 
    initialPositionPenalty: 0.2
};
```
